Technicians must have a certain level of ability and comfort before using various PC hardware. First, we will discuss the hazards of computer systems and tools, including electricity, electrostatic discharge (ESD), chemicals, and other hazards that may harm you when using various forms of computer hardware. We will also introduce the safety measures and procedures that must be used to minimize risks, such as the use of ESD straps, ESD mats, self-grounding systems and equipment grounding. Then, we will discuss personal safety, including removing jewelry to protect yourself and the computer, proper lifting techniques and weight restrictions, and removing power.

You can use a simple three-prong tester, voltmeter or multimeter to verify. In the procedure, do not pull the wire out of the wire, as this will cause damage and fraying of the cable. Instead, you should insert the plug and pull out the cable through the plug at the end of the power cord. \n In addition to protecting their own safety, technicians also need to protect computers from electrical damage. Surge protectors are usually used to protect computers from power spikes or power surges. Switchboards and surge protectors are not the same thing. The rated power unit of the surge protector is Joule (J). The rating indicates the number of joules that the surge protector can absorb before it fails. The higher the rating, the higher the protection of the computer. In addition, you must not overload surge protectors, or daisy-chain them, and you must not plug a surge protector into another surge protector: this will cause higher amperage consumption, which can lead to Fire. \n The above article told me that the difference between ups and sps includes an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages, and finally told me what to use to stabilize the voltage \n 上面的文章告訴我ups和sps的差別包含優缺點的分析,最後跟我說要使用什麼來穩定電壓 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '介紹.html'}, {'title': '操作程序：電氣安全', 'text': '在美國工作，則應該期望從辦公室或家庭的電源插座接收到115 VAC至120 VAC（交流電壓）的電壓。可以使用簡單的三叉測試儀，電壓表或萬用表進行驗證。程序上，切勿將電線從電線中拉出，因為這會導致電纜損壞和磨損。相反，您應該插入插頭並通過電源線末端的插頭拔出電纜。 \n 除了保護自己的安全外，技術人員還需要保護計算機免受電氣損壞。 通常使用電湧保護器來保護計算機免受電源尖峰或電湧的影響。 配電盤與電湧保護器不是一回事。 電湧保護器的額定功率單位為焦耳（J）。 額定值表示電湧保護器在故障之前可以吸收的焦耳數。 額定值越高，表示對計算機的保護越高。 另外，您一定不能使電湧保護器過載，也不能以菊花鏈的方式將它們電擊，也不能將一個電湧保護器插入另一個電湧保護器：這會導致更高的安培數消耗，從而引發火災。 \n When working with a computer, the largest amount of voltage you will find is located inside the computer’s power supply unit (PSU). You should\xa0 never \xa0 disassemble a PSU; when it is broken, simply replace the entire unit. Power supply units are relatively inexpensive, so it is a best practice to simply replace them. Some technicians wonder why they should not disassemble or open the PSU and try to fix it, but the reason is simple — it is \xa0 very \xa0 dangerous. A PSU has numerous electrical components that allow it to convert the high-voltage 115-120 VAC (or 230-240 VAC) power into the 12 VDC (volts direct current) that is usable by the computer. Some of these components are capacitors, which cause the power supply to retain lots of voltage (up to 10,000 volts or more) even after the computer is turned off and even after the computer and PSU are unplugged. Therefore, if you want to see the inside of a PSU, search for it on the Internet and look at a picture. It is much safer. \n 使用計算機時，您將發現的最大電壓位於計算機的電源設備（PSU）內部。您 切勿 \xa0 拆卸電源設備；損壞時，只需更換整個單元。電源設備價格相對便宜，因此最好是簡單地更換它們。一些技術人員想知道為什麼不應該拆卸或打開PSU並嘗試對其進行修復，但是原因很簡單-它 非常 \xa0 危險的。PSU具有許多電氣組件，可將115-120 VAC（或230-240 VAC）高壓電源轉換為計算機可使用的12 VDC（直流電壓）。這些組件中的一些是電容器，即使在關閉計算機後以及拔下計算機和PSU的電源後，電源也會保持大量電壓（最高10,000伏或更高）。因此，如果要查看PSU的內部，請在Internet上搜索並查看圖片。這更安全。 \n 計算機電源。 由 cand3la 根據CC-BY-NC許可使用 \n From this chapter, I can know that if you want uninterrupted power supply, you can use ups, and if you can turn on psu, you will be electrocuted.

These devices are specifically designed to absorb overvoltage conditions that would damage computers, printers, and monitors. While these devices will protect the computer from damage resulting from an overvoltage condition, they do not protect it from an undervoltage condition. Undervoltage is a condition that occurs when insufficient voltage is provided by the outlet to the computer. In situations where it is essential that the computer not lose power, technicians must install an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to provide emergency power when a power failure (blackout) occurs or an undervoltage condition (brownout) occurs. The UPS runs the computer from its internal battery continuously and recharges the UPS’s battery while power is available. Once power is lost, the UPS continues to power the computer for up to 15 minutes (purportedly). This provides the user enough time to save work and safely power down the workstation. Another device that helps in undervoltage conditions is the standby power supply (SPS), which runs the computer directly from the wall outlet (AC power), but switches to the battery in less than a millisecond when a power outage occurs. An SPS device does not provide constant power, like a UPS device. For this reason, most technicians prefer UPS devices over SPS devices, so UPS devices are much more common in the marketplace. \n 技術人員應使用電湧保護器或電湧抑制器來保護計算機免受電湧和電湧的影響。這些設備經過專門設計，可以吸收可能損壞計算機，打印機和顯示器的過電壓情況。儘管這些設備可以保護計算機免受過壓狀態造成的損壞，但它們不能保護計算機免受欠壓狀態的影響。當計算機的插座提供的電壓不足時，就會發生欠壓情況。在必須確保計算機不掉電的情況下，技術人員必須安裝不間斷電源（UPS），以在發生電源故障（停電）或發生欠壓情況（斷電）時提供應急電源。 UPS會使用其內部電池連續運行計算機，並在有電時為UPS的電池充電。一旦斷電，UPS將繼續為計算機供電長達15分鐘（據稱）。這為用戶提供了足夠的時間來節省工作並安全地關閉工作站電源。備用電源（SPS）是在欠壓情況下提供幫助的另一種設備，它可以直接從壁裝電源插座（交流電源）運行計算機，但是在發生斷電時，可以在不到一毫秒的時間內切換到電池。 SPS設備不像UPS設備那樣提供恆定功率。因此，與SPS設備相比，大多數技術人員更喜歡UPS設備，因此UPS設備在市場上更為普遍。 \n \n \n \n Reset this Activity \n \n \n \n Uninterruptible power supplies are rated in various ways, including their runtimes, network support capabilities, automatic shutdown capabilities, and surge suppression. The runtime dictates the amount of time a computer will keep running on power from the UPS’s battery once source power is removed. Usually, you want to use a UPS with at least 15 minutes of runtime support. The bigger the battery, the longer the runtime. The runtime is calculated based on volt-amps, which is discussed in more detail in a later section. UPS devices can also have software that allows them to be connected to the network. Therefore, when the UPS notices a drop in power, it can send out a message to the users that the network is being shut down because of power loss. Some UPS devices support automatic shutdown of the connected computer or server, so that once a switch to battery power occurs, the UPS sends a shutdown signal to the connected machine. Finally, most UPS devices also provide surge suppression capabilities, rated in joules. \n The last type of device technicians can use is called a power conditioner or line conditioner. These devices do not have any battery backup capability, but can rectify the power from a dirty power condition (where power fluctuates greatly) to a steady 115-120 VAC power condition. These devices can raise undervoltage conditions to normal levels, as well as cut overvoltage conditions back down to standard levels. This is very important if your systems are going to run from a backup generator, or if you are operating in an area with unstable power (such as in some developing countries). \n 重置此活動 不間斷電源的額定方式有多種，包括其運行時間，網絡支持功能，自動關機功能和電湧抑制。運行時間規定了斷開電源後計算機將繼續使用UPS電池供電的時間。通常，您要使用具有至少15分鐘運行時間支持的UPS。電池越大，運行時間越長。運行時間是基於伏安計算的，這將在後面的部分中詳細討論。 UPS設備還可以具有允許其連接到網絡的軟件。因此，當UPS注意到電源中斷時，它可以向用戶發送一條消息，通知您由於斷電而導致網絡正在關閉。某些UPS設備支持所連接的計算機或服務器的自動關機，因此一旦切換到電池電源，UPS就會向所連接的計算機發送關機信號。最後，大多數UPS設備還提供以焦耳為單位的電湧抑制功能。 \n 技術人員可以使用的最後一種設備稱為功率調節器或線路調節器。這些設備沒有任何備用電池功能，但是可以將電源從骯髒的電源狀況（電源波動很大）整流為穩定的115-120 VAC電源狀況。這些器件可將欠壓條件提高到正常水平，並將過壓條件降低迴標準水平。如果您的系統要使用備用發電機運行，或者您在電力不穩定的區域（例如在某些發展中國家）運行，則這非常重要。 \n The above article told me that the difference between ups and sps includes an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages, and finally told me what to use to stabilize the voltage \n 上面的文章告訴我ups和sps的差別包含優缺點的分析,最後跟我說要使用什麼來穩定電壓 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Power Supplies.html'}, {'title': 'Power Variation', 'text': '\n It is important to understand the technical terms for the various undervoltage and overvoltage conditions that could exist, such as power surge, dirty power, sag, brownout, and blackout, as well as the device that provides protection to the computers and computer system equipment when these conditions occur. A power surge occurs when a short increase in AC voltage happens, such as from 120 VAC to 130 VAC. To protect computers from this condition, you would use a surge suppressor. Dirty power occurs when AC voltage continuously fluctuates, for example between 113 VAC and 130 VAC. To correct this condition, an in-line UPS or line conditioner should be used. A sag occurs when an unexpected short decrease in voltage occurs. This can be corrected with either a line conditioner or a UPS. A brownout is a more significant, larger voltage drop than a sag, and could result in the voltage being cut in half (such as 120 VAC dropping to 60 VAC). This is too much for a line conditioner to handle, so a UPS would be required. Finally, if there is a complete loss of power, this is called a blackout. Only a UPS can solve this problem, but only for a short duration (purportedly about 15 minutes). If operations must continue after this, you would need to switch to a backup generator to provide the power required. \n \n \n \n learn by doing \n \n \n \n 重要的是要理解可能存在的各種欠壓和過壓條件的技術術語，例如電湧，臟電源，跌落，掉電和停電，以及在以下情況下為計算機和計算機系統設備提供保護的設備：這些情況發生。當交流電壓短暫升高時（例如從120 VAC增加到130 VAC），就會發生電湧。為了保護計算機免受這種情況的影響，應使用電湧抑制器。當交流電壓持續波動時（例如，在113 VAC和130 VAC之間），會產生臟電。要糾正這種情況，應使用串聯式UPS或線路調節器。當電壓出現意外的短時下降時，就會發生下垂。可以使用電源調節器或UPS進行糾正。掉電比下垂更為顯著，更大的電壓降，並且可能導致電壓降低一半（例如120 VAC降至60 VAC）。對於線路調節器來說，這太多了，因此需要UPS。最後，如果完全斷電，則稱為停電。只有UPS可以解決此問題，但只能持續很短的時間（據說大約15分鐘）。如果此後必須繼續操作，則需要切換到備用發電機以提供所需的電源。 通過實踐學習\xa0 \n \n did I get this \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Match the electrical protective measure with the electrical condition it is designed to mitigate. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Electrical Condition \n Description \n Protective Measure \n \n \n Power surge \n \n \n A short increase in AC voltage \n \n \n \n \n Surge suppressor \n \n \n \n \n Dirty power \n \n \n When AC voltage continuously fluctuates \n \n \n \n \n Line conditioner or uninterruptible power supply (UPS) \n \n \n \n \n Sag \n \n \n An unexpected short decrease in voltage \n \n \n \n \n Line conditioner or uninterruptible power supply (UPS) \n \n \n \n \n Brownout \n \n \n Larger voltage drop than a sag \n \n \n \n \n Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) \n \n \n \n \n Blackout \n \n \n Total loss of power for extended period of time. \n \n \n \n \n Generator \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Correct.

If a computer or outlet catches on fire, you should use a class C extinguisher, which is a carbon dioxide (CO 2 )-based extinguisher. You should not attempt to extinguish an electrical fire with water, because water conducts electricity. If the fire is small, you may use a portable extinguisher to put the fire out immediately, but you should never put yourself in harm’s way. If the fire begins to get out of control, everyone should move to a safe area and call 911 for help immediately. Some server rooms have built-in fire suppression systems that release CO 2 \xa0 or halon when a fire alarm occurs. Halon is a toxic compressed gas, in liquid form, that chemically disrupts a combustion reaction. A CO 2 \xa0 system is designed to flood the room with carbon dioxide in order to remove all oxygen from the room, thereby killing the fire. People who are working in a server room and hear the fire alarm sounding must immediately vacate the area and get to a safe location. This is a life-threatening situation, both because of the fire and because of the potentially lethal nature of the fire-suppression systems. \n 電力可能是引起火災的常見原因，尤其是在電路過載的情況下。如果計算機或插座著火，則應使用C類滅火器，它是一種基於二氧化碳（CO2）的滅火器。您不應嘗試用水滅火，因為水可以導電。如果火很小，則可以使用便攜式滅火器將火立即撲滅，但絕對不要讓自己受傷。如果火勢開始失控，所有人應移至安全區域並立即撥打119尋求幫助。一些服務器機房具有內置的滅火系統，當發生火災警報時，這些系統會釋放CO2或哈龍。哈龍是有毒的壓縮氣體，呈液態，化學上會破壞燃燒反應。 CO2系統設計用於向房間充斥二氧化碳，以清除房間中的所有氧氣，從而撲滅大火。在服務器機房中工作且聽到火警警報的人員必須立即離開該區域並到達安全位置。由於起火以及滅火系統的潛在致命特性，這是威脅生命的情況。 This chapter talks about using a fire extinguisher to extinguish 3c fire, and how to deal with it 這章說滅3c著火要用滅火器，和遇到時如何應對 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Protecting People and Property.html'}, {'title': 'Operational Procedures: Electrostatic Discharge', 'text': '\xa0 \n Another major safety hazard for computer systems and components is electrostatic discharge (ESD). ESD damage is caused by the discharge of static electricity that has been built up by the human body in the course of everyday events, such as walking, standing and sitting at our desks, and other activities. In drier (less humid) environments, static electricity builds up more quickly and becomes more of an issue. This is especially true during winter months. While static electricity cannot directly harm humans very much, it can be deadly to computer components. A person builds static electricity that can reach 20,000 to 25,000 volts, but is of a low amperage (making it safe for humans). When you touch something of lower electrical potential, such as the metal case of the computer or the circuit board of an expansion card, the static electricity in your body is discharged into that component, causing damage. If you touch a circuit board without taking ESD precautions, ESD may occur and cause permanent failure or an intermittent failure of the component. \n You can protect computer equipment from ESD fairly easily. First, you should use an antistatic wrist strap, also known as an ESD strap. \n 計算機系統和組件的另一個主要安全隱患是靜電放電（ESD）。 ESD損壞是由人體在日常活動過程中（例如走路，站立和坐在辦公桌旁以及其他活動中）積聚的靜電釋放引起的。在乾燥（濕度較低）的環境中，靜電積聚更快，成為一個更大的問題。在冬季尤其如此。儘管靜電不會直接對人類造成太大傷害，但對計算機組件而言可能是致命的。一個人產生的靜電可以達到20,000到25,000伏，但電流強度很低（對人類安全）。當您觸摸電勢較低的物體（例如計算機的金屬外殼或擴充卡的電路板）時，體內的靜電會釋放到該組件中，從而造成損壞。如果在未採取ESD預防措施的情況下觸摸電路板，則可能會發生ESD，並導致組件永久性故障或間歇性故障。 您可以相當容易地保護計算機設備免受ESD的影響。首先，應使用防靜電腕帶，也稱為ESD腕帶。 \n ESD strap. Photo used under CC-BY-ND license from\xa0 Carl Bereley . \n These devices are very inexpensive and are the best method of protecting equipment against ESD. To be effective, one end of the strap must be grounded (by clipping it to something such as to the bare metal of the computer case), and the other end is placed around your wrist like a bracelet. This continually causes a discharge from the body to the computer case, thereby protecting the internal computer components. Because of the high voltage present inside a cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor, you should not wear an ESD wrist strap when working inside a CRT monitor. \n If you do not have an ESD strap, you can employ the second precautionary method, called grounding against the chassis. In this method, you touch any unpainted metal part of the computer case to discharge the static electricity from your body before touching the sensitive components (such as expansion cards). This method is quite good, but you must remember to ground yourself against the case \xa0 every \xa0 time before touching a component. The last precautionary method is to use anti-static bags. This procedure is useful during transport of various components. Basically, you place the components and cards inside the anti-static bag to protect them from ESD while you are carrying them from one location to another. \n Anti-static bag. Photo used under CC-BY license from \xa0 Joe Hall . \n 這些設備非常便宜，是保護設備免受ESD影響的最佳方法。為使之有效，必須將腕帶的一端接地（通過將其修剪到諸如計算機機殼裸露的東西上），另一端像手鐲一樣放在手腕上。這連續地導致從身體向計算機機殼的放電，從而保護了計算機內部組件。由於陰極射線管（CRT）監視器內部存在高壓，因此在CRT監視器內部進行操作時，請勿佩戴ESD腕帶。 如果沒有ESD綁帶，則可以採用第二種預防方法，即與機箱接地。通過這種方法，在觸摸敏感組件（例如擴展卡）之前，請觸摸計算機機箱上任何未上漆的金屬部分，以從身上釋放靜電。這種方法非常好，但是每次觸摸組件之前，您都必須記住要使自己與外殼接觸。最後一種預防方法是使用防靜電袋。此過程在運輸各種組件時很有用。基本上，將組件和卡從一個位置運送到另一位置時，請將其放置在防靜電袋中，以防止靜電。 \n To prevent ESD we must ensure we handle components properly. Never touch the face of the cards where the components and wiring are located; only handle cards by the edges. Additionally, always use proper ESD straps or grounding techniques before handling the cards. You also should remove jewelry and avoid loose clothes, since they may get caught in the computer or inadvertently cause a static charge to be transferred into a component. Another great technique is the use of an anti-static mat or workbench. Many server rooms and IT shops have these mats installed, and they provide a good method of keeping yourself grounded while working. You can also raise the humidity of the room to minimize the chances of static build-up. Most computer server rooms keep humidity between 40 and 50 percent to minimize electrostatic build-up, but often you will not have control over the humidity as a technician. You also want to avoid carpeted areas when possible, as walking across carpet creates a faster buildup of static electricity in the body. Finally, never use electrical or magnetic tools on the workstation, as the electrical motors from drills, impact wrenches, and vacuums create static electricity that can be discharged into fragile components. \n 為了防止ESD，我們必須確保正確處理組件。切勿觸摸組件和配線所在的卡的表面；只能處理邊緣的卡。此外，在處理插卡之前，請始終使用正確的ESD腕帶或接地技術。您還應卸下珠寶首飾並避免穿寬鬆的衣服，因為它們可能會卡在計算機中或無意間將靜電轉移到組件中。另一個很棒的技術是使用防靜電墊或工作台。許多服務器機房和IT商店都安裝了這些墊子，它們是在工作時保持接地的一種好方法。您還可以提高房間的濕度，以最大程度減少靜電積聚的機會。大多數計算機服務器機房將濕度保持在40％到50％之間，以最大程度地減少靜電積聚，但是作為技術人員，您通常無法控制濕度。您還希望盡可能避免舖有地毯的區域，因為在地毯上行走會在體內更快地積聚靜電。最後，切勿在工作站上使用電動工具或電磁工具，因為鑽頭，衝擊扳手和真空吸塵器產生的電動機會產生靜電，這些靜電會排放到易碎的部件中。 \n From the above, you can learn how to prevent static electricity from damaging the computer \n 從上文可以了解到如何防止靜電對計算機造成損害 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Operational Procedures: Electrostatic Discharge.html'}, {'title': 'Operational Procedure Environmental Controls', 'text': 'So, what is the best range of environmental controls to protect our workstations and provide our computers with the best operating environment? For temperature, we seek a range of 68-76 degrees Fahrenheit, and we attempt to keep the humidity between 20 and 60 percent. If the humidity is higher, it prevents electrostatic buildup. If the humidity is too high, though, condensation and water vapor can occur. It is a fragile balance, but the best rule of thumb is that if humans are comfortable, the environment is probably within the specifications. Also, we need to ensure proper ventilation for both people and computers. We want to minimize the dust in the environment and ensure adequate cooling to remove the heat created by the workstations. \n Additionally, we need to consider the chemicals that we often encounter in our daily jobs. Each product that uses chemicals must have a material safety data sheet (MSDS) with it. This sheet includes the proper treatment if a person comes into contact with the substance, how to deal with chemical spills, how to properly dispose of the chemicals, and proper storage of the substance. MSDS are required for \xa0 all \xa0 products with chemicals, including things like window cleaning solution as well as more complex compounds like the thermal paste that we use in workstations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 那麼，保護我們的工作站並為我們的計算機提供最佳操作環境的最佳環境控制範圍是什麼？對於溫度，我們尋求的溫度範圍為華氏68-76度，並且嘗試將濕度保持在20％到60％之間。如果濕度較高，則可防止靜電積聚。但是，如果濕度太高，則會發生冷凝和水蒸氣。這是一個脆弱的平衡，但是最好的經驗法則是，如果人類感到舒適，則環境可能在規格範圍內。此外，我們需要確保人和計算機的通風良好。我們希望最大程度地減少環境中的灰塵，並確保充分冷卻以消除工作站產生的熱量。\n\n此外，我們需要考慮日常工作中經常遇到的化學物質。每個使用化學藥品的產品都必須隨附材料安全數據表（MSDS）。該表包括如果有人接觸該物質應採取的適當處理措施，如何處理化學溢出物，如何正確處置該化學物質以及正確存儲該物質。所有含化學物質的產品都需要MSDS，包括窗戶清潔液以及更複雜的化合物（例如我們在工作站中使用的導熱膏）。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This chapter let me know the temperature and humidity for the computer \n 本章讓我知道計算機適合溫度和濕度 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Operational Procedure Environmental Controls.html'}, {'title': 'Operational Procedures Physical Safety', 'text': 'Since we have considered the electrical dangers a technician might face, we must also consider the physical dangers. As information technology technicians, we often are involved in the “rollout” and replacement of existing systems, and in moving equipment from one office area to another. In this portion of our jobs, we often have to move hundreds of computers. Remember, the number one cause of injury for computer technicians is lifting items that are too heavy for us. A couple of rules of thumb to prevent injury: Do not lift anything over 25 percent of your own weight without assistance. Second, remember to always lift with your legs, not your back. If you follow these two simple rules, you can avoid the most common injuries in the workplace. \n \n \n \n \n 由於我們已經考慮了技術人員可能面臨的電氣危險，因此我們還必須考慮物理危險。作為信息技術人員，我們經常參與“部署”和替換現有系統，以及將設備從一個辦公區域轉移到另一個辦公區域。在這部分工作中，我們經常不得不移動數百台計算機。請記住，計算機技術人員受傷的首要原因是提起對我們來說太重的物品。防止受傷的一些經驗法則：不要在沒有幫助的情況下舉起超過自身體重25％的東西。其次，請記住始終抬起雙腿，而不是背部。如果遵循這兩個簡單規則，則可以避免在工作場所中最常見的傷害。 \n \n \n \n \n Another area of concern is our impatience. Often when we go to work on a computer, we first turn off the machine and then open it up. Many of us forget that the computer may have been on and running for the past several days or weeks, building up an enormous amount of heat that can cause burns. It is a good idea to wait at least 15 minutes before touching items at the workstation, such as a laser printer’s fuser, the central processing unit (CPU) of the computer, or the power supply of the computer. These areas tend to generate the most heat and need time to dissipate the heat prior to maintenance. \n 另一個值得關注的領域是我們的耐心。通常，當我們在計算機上工作時，首先關閉機器，然後再打開它。我們中的許多人都忘記了計算機可能已經在過去的幾天或幾週內開機並運行，從而積聚了大量的熱量，可能引起灼傷。最好等待至少15分鐘，然後再觸摸工作站上的物品，例如激光打印機的定影器，計算機的中央處理器（CPU）或計算機的電源。這些區域往往會產生最多的熱量，並且在維護之前需要花費一定時間消散熱量。\n \n Finally, we must be wary of how we route cables, and must practice proper cable management. Do not run cables in the walkways or through places where employees may trip over them. If a worker trips on the cord, not only will the worker get hurt, but the workstation itself could be pulled off the desk and damaged. Place the computer and cables in a place where adequate air flow can occur; otherwise, the computer may overheat and have issues functioning. Finally, always remember to check local regulations when installing new network cables. Some areas require certain licenses or certifications, such as an electrician’s license, to run network cables. Also, you will need to install \xa0 plenum-rated cables \xa0 if you are running them in areas such as the ceiling, where ventilation systems are found. \n 最後，我們必須警惕如何佈設電纜，並且必須進行適當的電纜管理。請勿在走道或員工可能絆倒的地方穿過電纜。如果工人用電線絆倒，不僅會受傷，而且工作站本身可能會從桌子上拉下來並損壞。將計算機和電纜放置在可產生足夠空氣流通的地方；否則，計算機可能會過熱並出現問題。最後，在安裝新的網絡電纜時，請務必記住檢查當地法規。有些地區需要某些許可證或證明（例如電工許可證）才能運行網絡電纜。另外，如果要在通風良好的區域（例如天花板）上鋪設增壓電纜，則需要安裝增壓電纜。 \n Proper cable management. Photo used under CC-BY-NC license from \xa0 Adrian Black . \n So, why is cable management so important? Well, imagine your boss just told you that her workstation lost its connection to the network. You run down to the server room to see if you can troubleshoot her connection. You look first to check if her cable is plugged in, but you find the mess of cables below. How do you determine which is your boss’ connection? This mess causes issues with ventilation, cooling, and more importantly issues when trying to troubleshoot. Always run the cabling with proper cable management techniques and label the cables to assist you in the future during troubleshooting. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 那麼，為什麼電纜管理如此重要？好吧，想像一下您的老闆剛剛告訴您她的工作站失去了與網絡的連接。您跑到服務器機房查看是否可以解決她的連接故障。您首先要檢查她的電纜是否已插入，但在下面發現電纜亂七八糟。您如何確定老闆的聯繫方式？這種混亂會導致通風，冷卻問題，更重要的是，嘗試進行故障排除時會出現問題。始終使用適當的電纜管理技術來佈線，並標記電纜，以在將來進行故障排除時為您提供幫助。 \n \n \n \n \n Unsafe cables.

These older monitors look like old televisions. These monitors tend to be very heavy, with 30” or larger models weighing nearly a hundred pounds. It is important to remember your lifting rules before moving these monitors. Most people are upgrading these old monitors to LCD or LED models, since they offer better picture quality and are much lighter. Many locations have special disposal rules for these devices. Many localities have a requirement to recycle monitors at a central waste facility. Finally, these monitors use capacitors to perform their functions. You must be careful not to open these monitors, as they can have 10,000-20,000 volts of potential voltage, even when they have been unplugged for long periods of time. \n 您可能在現場發現的許多較舊的顯示器都是CRT顯示器。這些較舊的監視器看起來像舊電視。這些監視器往往非常重，具有30英寸或更大的型號，重近一百磅。在移動這些顯示器之前，請記住您的舉升規則，這一點很重要。大多數人都將這些舊顯示器升級為LCD或LED型號，因為它們提供了更好的圖像質量並且更輕。許多位置對於這些設備都有特殊的處置規則。許多地方都要求在中央廢物處理設施回收監測器。最後，這些監視器使用電容器來執行其功能。您必須小心不要打開這些顯示器，因為它們可能具有10,000-20,000伏的潛在電壓，即使長時間拔下電源也是如此。 The old screen is not only bulky and can’t be opened, even if it’s unplugged for a long time, it will be electrocuted \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 舊型得螢幕不但笨重且不可以打開就算拔插頭很久了會被電死 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Operational Procedures Physical Safety.html'}]};
